## Forwader

The application allows simple forwarding of shorter URLs to specified longer URL's. A url can be set by going to `www.example.com/set/` which will be accessable at `www.example.com`. Multiple URL's can be set at once. For example setting a URL at `www.example.com/set/5` will be accessable via `www.exmaple.com/5`. This currently only works via numbers.
